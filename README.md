# JR Dev Container features
This repo contains a collection of [dev container features](https://containers.dev/implementors/features/).

See their respective README files for further details.

- [direnv](src/direnv/README.md)
- [poetry](src/poetry/README.md)

The features are not specific for JobRad but we do not regard them as general purpose features either. They are rather a collection of features that we found useful in our development environment.
We do not treat them as (external) products and provide no support whatsoever.
